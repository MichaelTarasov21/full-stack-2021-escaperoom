This branch was created in order to isolate room 4 (the room I worked on) from the rest of the rooms created for the project so that I could add it to my portfolio.

This is necessary due to the long length of the project making it difficult to get to the final room in a timely matter.

Leaderboard functionality will be turned off in this brnach since the full game has not been played.
